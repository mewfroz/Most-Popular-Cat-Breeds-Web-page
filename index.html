                    <br><h3>History</h3><br>
                    <p>
                         You may not realize it, but you probably grew up with the British Shorthair. 
                         He is the clever feline of Puss in Boots and the grinning Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland.
                         The British Shorthair is native to England. 
                         With the rise of cat shows during the Victorian era, cat fanciers began to breed the cats to a particular standard and keep pedigrees for them. At the earliest cat shows, British Shorthairs were the only pedigreed cats exhibited. 
                         All others were simply described by coat type or color.Two world wars devastated the breed, and few British Shorthairs remained after World War II. With the help of other breeds, the Shorthairs, as they are called in Britain, were revitalized. 
                         The American Cat Association recognized the British Shorthair in 1967, but the Cat Fanciers Association did not accept it until 1980. 
                         Now, all cat associations recognize the breed.

                    </p><br>
               
                    <h3>Personality</h3><br>
                    <p>

                    The British Shorthair is mellow and easygoing, making him an excellent family companion. He enjoys affection, but he’s not a “me, me, me” type of cat. Expect him to follow you around the house during the day, settling nearby wherever you stop. Full of British reserve, the Shorthair has a quiet voice and is an undemanding companion. He doesn’t require a lap, although he loves to sit next to you. 
                    Being a big cat, he isn’t fond of being carried around. This is a cat with a moderate activity level. He’s energetic during kittenhood, but usually starts to settle down by the time he is a year old. More mature British Shorthairs are usually couch potatoes, but adult males occasionally behave like goofballs. When they run through the house, they can sound like a herd of elephants.
                    British Shorthairs are rarely destructive; their manners are those of a proper governess, not a soccer hooligan. They welcome guests confidently.
                    </p><br>
                
                    <h3>Care</h3><br>
                    <p>

                        The British Shorthair’s short, smooth coat is simple to groom with weekly brushing or combing to remove dead hairs. 
                        A bath is rarely necessary. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails weekly. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. 
                        Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear. 
                        Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene.
                        It’s a good idea to keep a British Shorthair as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. 
                        British Shorthairs who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.

                <h3><br>History</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The Pixie-Bob breed is thought to have started from the unplanned litter of a bobcat and a barn cat in 1985. 
                    The barn cat belonged to Carol Ann Brewer, and she named a female kitten Pixie. Pixie became the foundation mother for this breed. 
                    While there is no hard proof that Pixie’s father was actually a wildcat, it is widely believed and accepted by breeders. 
                    The International Cat Association (TICA) officially recognized the Pixie-Bob as a breed in 1994. 
                    It took the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) up until 2005 to follow suit and accept the Pixie-Bob as a recognized breed. 
                    Breeders are still hoping that the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) will soon start accepting the Pixie-Bob as a breed as well.
                </p><br>
            

 
                <h3><br>Personality</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Pixie-Bobs may have been created out of wild passion, but for the most part, Pixie-Bobs are a mellow sort of cat. 
                    Pixie-Bobs love to be with their owners, but Pixie-Bobs are not considered hyperactive by any stretch of the imagination. 
                    These cats enjoy laid-back hang sessions with the family and have been described as “dog-like” in personality. 
                    Pixie-Bobs bond very strongly with their families and love taking car rides and leashed walks with their loved ones. 
                    This is what makes the Pixie-Bob an ideal cat for families with children. 
                    Pixie-Bob’s ability to bond with their humans along with their patient personas make them excellent companions for children.
                </p><br>
            

           
                <h3><br>Care</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Pixie-Bobs do not inherently have many health issues, but basic care is a must for these large cats. 
                    An issue that can arise with Pixie-Bobs is a little extra weight. 
                    Be sure to maintain your Pixie-Bob’s weight at a healthy point and not mistake it for him simply being a large cat.

            <h3><br>History</h3><br>
            <p>
                From Russia with love: that’s the Siberian, a glamorous native cat from the taiga of Siberia, a forested area with a subarctic climate that no doubt contributed to this cat’s long, thick, protective coat. 
                The cats have been known in Russia for some 1,000 years and often figure in Russian folktales.
                As in every culture, the cats were prized for their hunting ability by householders and shopkeepers. 
                They kept mice and rats well away from stores of grain and other foods.
                Siberians were first imported to the United States in 1990 and were recognized by The International Cat Association in 1996. 
                The American Cat Fanciers Association accepted the breed in 1999, followed by the Cat Fanciers Association in 2006. 
                The breed is gaining popularity because it has a reputation for being hypoallergenic—which may or may not be the case, depending on the individual person.
            </p><br>
        

            <h3><br>Personality</h3><br>
            <p>
                The Siberian’s heart is as warm as his homeland is cold. 
                He loves people and wants to be near them, so expect this affectionate cat to follow you around, including to the bathroom, and to “help” you with all of your reading, TV viewing, computer work and meal prep. 
                Sitting in your lap while you comb his fur may well be the highlight of his day. When you come home from work, he might not have a martini waiting, but he will be pleased to tell you all about his day in quiet, pleasant trills and chirps, interspersed with a few meows and purrs. 
                Guests will find him to be a genial host; this is not typically a cat who is shy in the presence of strangers.
                Besides being loving and attentive, the Siberian is also active and playful. 
                He will instigate games of fetch by bringing you a favorite toy to throw. 
                Any item can become a plaything for this clever cat, so keep jewelry or other potentially intriguing items out of his sight. 
                Teaching him tricks is a fun and easy way to challenge his agile brain.
                Because of his heritage as a forest dweller, he likes playing with water—perhaps it’s a genetic memory of going fishing for his supper. 
                Don’t be surprised if he enjoys splashing you in the tub, drinking from a fountain or faucet, or making puddles by batting his paw in his water dish. 
                As befits a working and hunting cat, he’s highly athletic and you may find him balancing atop a doorway or propelling himself to the highest point in the room. In fact, Siberian coaches may well be the secret to the success of Russian gymnasts.
                Activity and noise won’t bother him a bit. His calm nature gives him the potential to be a therapy cat. If nothing else, he will be happy to snuggle with you when you’re down with a cold or other illness. 
                And although he loves attention, he’s not needy and will wait patiently until you have time to devote to him.
            </p><br>
        

       
            <h3><br>Care</h3>
            <p>
                The Siberian’s thick triple coat should be combed or brushed a couple of times a week to prevent tangles or mats. 
                The coat will shed seasonally in the spring and fall, and you may need to groom more frequently during that time. 
                A bath is rarely necessary, which is a good thing because the coat is highly water-resistant. 
                It can be difficult to get a Siberian wet enough to shampoo him.
                Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. 
                Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. 
                Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. 
                Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.
                Check the ears weekly.
                If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. 
                Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.
                Most of the Siberian’s growth occurs in his first year and a half of life. 
                Your kitten’s breeder may recommend that you feed him kitten food during that time to make sure he gets enough nourishment.
                Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will also help to keep the long coat clean.
                It’s a good idea to keep a Siberian as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. 
                Siberians who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it. If possible, build your Siberian a large outdoor enclosure where he can jump and climb safely.

            <h3><br>History</h3><br>
            <p>
                If you are wondering if the Ragamuffin is related to the Ragdoll, the answer is yes. 
                Some breeders wanted to introduce new colors and patterns while others thought it was important to widen the breed’s gene pool. 
                Because the breeding of Ragdolls was strictly controlled by that breed’s founder, Ann Baker, a new group formed to create its own breed. 
                They outcrossed to Persians, Himalayans and domestic longhaired cats, to increase the size and to bring about other changes in appearance that would differentiate the Ragamuffin from the Ragdoll. 
                The name Ragamuffin was chosen in part as an homage to the founding breed.
                Cat associations that recognize the Ragamuffin are the United Feline Organization—the first to do so—the American Cat Fanciers Association, the American Association of Cat Enthusiasts, and the Cat Fanciers Federation. 
                The Ragamuffin most recently gained full recognition from the Cat Fanciers Association, in February 2011.
            </p><br>
        

        
            <h3><br>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                Like his cousin the Ragdoll, the Ragamuffin is a huggable lug who wants nothing more than to follow his people around and sit in a lap whenever possible. 
                A nice combination of sweet and smart, he is often described as puppylike for his friendly personality and willingness to play fetch, learn tricks and walk on a leash. 
                He greets visitors warmly and would meet you at the door with a martini if only he had opposable thumbs.
                The Ragamuffin is known for his docile nature. He loves to be held like a baby and will completely relax into your arms. 
                Ragamuffins like to play but are good about limiting their attentions to their toys and scratching posts, not your furniture. 
                It is rare to nonexistent for them to lay a claw on a person.
                This is a mellow cat but one who craves attention. Don’t get a Ragamuffin if you will have to leave him alone for many hours every day.
            </p><br>
       

        
            <h3><br>Care</h3>
            <p>
                The Ragamuffin’s soft coat is long, but its texture is tangle-resistant. Weekly brushing or combing is all that’s needed to remove dead hairs and keep it looking beautiful.
                Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. 
                Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.
                Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. 
                Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.
                Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene.
                The Ragamuffin has a fearless personality, so it’s never a good idea to let him go outside. 
                He has no notion that other people or animals might mean him harm and is not “street smart” in the least. 
                Ragamuffins who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
